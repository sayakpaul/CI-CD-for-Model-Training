# CI/CD for Model Training in ML

This repository holds files and scripts for incorporating simple CI/CD practices for model training in ML. Following
references have been used to prepare the files under the `build` directory:

* [Vertex AI Training with TFX and Vertex Pipelines](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/tfx/gcp/vertex_pipelines_vertex_training)
* [MLOps with Vertex AI by GCP](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/mlops-with-vertex-ai)

This repository exists to supplement my learning and may or may not include substantial documentation.
