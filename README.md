# CI/CD for Model Training in ML

This repository holds files and scripts for incorporating simple CI/CD practices for model training in ML. Following
resources have been used to prepare the files under the `build` directory:

* [Vertex AI Training with TFX and Vertex Pipelines](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/tfx/gcp/vertex_pipelines_vertex_training)
* [MLOps with Vertex AI by GCP](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/mlops-with-vertex-ai)

Another accompanying repository for the purpose of CI/CD for model training can be found here: [deep-diver/Model-Training-as-a-CI-CD-System](https://github.com/deep-diver/Model-Training-as-a-CI-CD-System). More documentation will be added soon.
